I recreated the results of this paper as part of my training. The objective is to observe the performance of optimum diversity combining system when the channel estimation is imperfect. Channels are modeled as true channel gain plus independent gaussian distributed estimation errors. Paper considers both the rayleigh and rician fading channels. The papers shows that convention Maximal Ratio Combining(MRC) is not optimal when channel estimation error is present. Using Maxium a posteriori(MAP) rule the paper derives the optimum decision rule and decision variable.For detection euclidean distance between all the possible symbols which could be sent and decision variable is calculated, then the symbol with least distance is selected. Theoretial error calculation for the Rayleigh Fading Case has been done with the help of MGF method, where an identity relating MGF of chi^2 random variable is used (see eqn. 25). For error calculation of rician fading channel the integral is manipulated in such a way that it resembles the functioinal form of Gaussian distribution.
